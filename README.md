# Tourism Dashboard Internship

This repository highlights the work I completed during my internship at **Amaris Consulting** from **June 3, 2024, to July 26, 2024**. The main focus of my internship was to develop a comprehensive tourism dashboard for Tunisia, leveraging data analysis and visualization tools to provide actionable insights.

## 📋 **Overview**

During my internship, I developed a Tourism Dashboard aimed at analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) for the tourism sector in Tunisia. The dashboard provided insights into:

- Tourist profiles and motivations.
- Domestic and international tourism flows.
- Economic impacts, including contributions to GDP and employment.
- Air transport trends and seasonal variations.

This work was completed using **Power BI** as the primary tool for data visualization and analysis, following the **Agile Scrum** methodology.
